"""Single load point for the compiled Rust extensions.

Why this module exists
----------------------
Each caller used to import the extensions itself, and two different spellings
were in use::

    import p2_s3_crypto                     # -> site-packages (maturin install)
    from p2.s3 import p2_s3_crypto          # -> p2/s3/p2_s3_crypto.so (checked-in)

Those resolve to *different files*, so a process could load two independent
copies of the same extension at once. That actually happened: the checked-in
``.so`` was two weeks older than the installed wheel and was missing
``write_blocks_uring``. Only ``volume_writer`` used the top-level spelling, so
only ``volume_writer`` saw the new function -- every other caller silently ran
against the stale build. Because each copy has its own ``OnceLock`` statics,
the process also ended up with two independent io_uring runtime threads that
could never share a registered descriptor table.

Routing every caller through this module means one module object per extension
per process, and one place to control what happens when a load fails.

Failure behaviour
-----------------
Historically each call site swallowed ``ImportError`` and fell back to a pure
Python path, logging at DEBUG. That is how a stale/missing binary went
unnoticed for so long: throughput quietly dropped and nothing said why. Here a
failed load is reported at WARNING, and a build that loads but lacks expected
symbols is reported at ERROR, since that indicates a stale artifact rather than
an absent one.

Set ``P2_REQUIRE_NATIVE=1`` to turn both conditions into a hard startup
failure. Recommended for benchmarking and production, so a silent fallback can
never be mistaken for a real measurement.
